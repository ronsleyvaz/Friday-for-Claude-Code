# Friday Foundation

Build your own AI Chief of Staff inside Claude Code. Seven commands, a growth diagnostic, and a harness to extend it to your workflow.

Free and open-source. No account. No server. Everything runs on your machine.

---

## Install in one line

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronsleyvaz/Friday-Foundation/main/install.sh | bash
```

You need Claude Code installed first. Get it at https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code

The installer drops the commands into `~/.claude/commands/`, fetches `CLAUDE.md.template` and the harness guide to your current directory, and tells you what to do next.

---

## Start here

Open Claude Code in your project directory and run:

```
/voice-installer
```

This is the foundation. It reads your writing samples, builds a voice profile, and writes it to `friday/voice.md`. Every command that runs after reads that profile and writes in your voice instead of generic AI voice.

Want the full walkthrough first? The manual covers every command, the `friday/` folder, and how to extend Foundation: [`docs/foundation-manual.md`](docs/foundation-manual.md).

## What each command does

| Command | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `/voice-installer` | Builds your voice profile from writing samples | `friday/voice.md` |
| `/brief` | Filters today's priorities through your nine decisions | `friday/morning.md` |
| `/decide` | Runs the 1-3-1 protocol: one problem, three options, one pick | `friday/decisions.md` |
| `/meetingprep` | Prepares you for any meeting in five minutes | `friday/meetings.md` |
| `/weeklyreview` | Structured weekly review and one clear priority | `friday/review.md` |
| `/amplify` | Runs the Amplify growth diagnostic on your numbers | `friday/growth.md` |
| `/new-capability` | Scaffolds a new command from a template | `commands/<name>.md` |

Each command writes to a `friday/` folder in your project directory. That folder is your config, growing over time.

## The Amplify growth diagnostic

`/amplify` is the flagship capability.

It walks you through eight business vital signs, detects your growth stage, maps to your priority quadrant (Revenue, Brand, Audience, or Operations), runs an ethics check on the recommendation, and writes a 90-day plan to `friday/growth.md`.

It takes about five minutes. It tells you where to push next and which AI tools to use first, matched to your experience level.

Based on the Amplify AI method. Full breakdown in the book: https://www.amazon.com/Amplify-Integrating-Intelligence-Humanity-Acceleration/dp/1998756831

---

## Install a single command

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronsleyvaz/Friday-Foundation/main/install.sh | bash -s -- amplify
```

Replace `amplify` with any command name to install just that one.

---

## Build your own command

Run `/new-capability <name>` in Claude Code. It scaffolds a command file with the right frontmatter and step structure.

For a full walkthrough, read the harness guide (fetched to `./harness/` when you install):

- `harness/00-how-friday-works.md` -- the mental model
- `harness/01-add-a-command.md` -- write your first custom command
- `harness/02-add-an-agent.md` -- build a specialist agent
- `harness/03-connect-your-own-tools.md` -- wire your own APIs and CLIs
- `harness/04-the-friday-folder.md` -- how the config grows
- `harness/05-the-amplify-logic.md` -- the Amplify method explained
